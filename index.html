            <p>Dear Ate Mahal,</p>
            <p>I know you will be celebrating your birthday alone and working, 
                so I will make it extra special by making you this IT thing. 
                Ka special ba oii, gi code-an man hahahaha. Bitaw Te Mahal, 
                ever since we are still a child you always make sure na, we, 
                your siblings know things that you knew, kanang imong motto nga 
                "di pwedeg ako ray kahibalo, dapat kamo sd", with that I am very thankful of, 
                you are a selfless sister, you always share your blessings.</p>
            <p>I don't believe to everyone saying you don't look up to your family, 
                because you did, i have seen it and felt it, you just have your own ways, 
                knowing that there's still an inner child that hasn't been healed within in you, 
                that's a brave move. I just wanna share to you my go-to-quote, "this too shall pass" 
                that whatever circumstances in your life, it wont last forever, and puhon2 all will be well, 
                kaya kapit ka lang jan, on the way na lagi ang American Dream. Gi nganlan kag Christ for a reason, 
                because just like Jesus Christ, he was stumbled many times on his journey to the cross, 
                means that the struggles we face are not meant to defeat us but to refine us, 
                shaping us into a better person.  Let the journey to the cross inspire you to rise above 
                adversity with grace and courage. I know there's a lot of people talk trash behind your back
                 but i know the truth, and that i will hold till forever. YOU ARE A GOOD SISTER AND A GOOD DAUGHTER. 
                 Basta dating gawi, if you need a sisterly advice, I will always got your back.  </p>
            <p>I love you Te Mahal mwah mwah, stay safe ka jan sa Republic of Colorado.</p>
